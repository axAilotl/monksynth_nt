A monophonic vocal synthesizer that sounds like a monk chanting. Built using formant-wave-function (FOF) synthesis, inspired by the classic [Delay Lama](http://www.audionerdz.nl/) VST plugin by AudioNerdz (2002).

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/JonET/monksynth/releases)** — available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

*MonkSynth v0.0.1-beta.1 in Ableton Live 12, with the classic skin imported from the original Delay Lama DLL*

## Features

- FOF synthesis engine producing realistic vocal formants
- XY pad for real-time pitch and vowel control
- Built-in stereo delay effect
- MIDI support: note on/off, pitch bend (vowel), CC1 (vibrato), CC5 (glide), CC7 (volume), CC12 (delay), CC13 (voice)
- ADSR envelope with configurable attack, decay, sustain, release
- Unison mode with up to 10 detuned voices and voice spread
- Theme system with right-click context menu for custom skins
- Import classic skin from the original Delay Lama DLL
- 5 factory presets
- VST3 plugin format (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Audio Unit (macOS)

## Building

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.20+
- C/C++ compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)

### Build

```bash
cd cpp
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release --target MonkSynth
```

The VST3 SDK is fetched automatically by CMake. The built plugin is placed in your system VST3 directory.

### macOS Audio Unit

To also build the AU plugin, install the [AudioUnit SDK](https://github.com/apple/AudioUnitSDK) and configure with:

```bash
cmake -B build -G Xcode -DSMTG_AUDIOUNIT_SDK_PATH=/path/to/AudioUnitSDK
cmake --build build --config Release --target MonkSynth-au
```

## Installation

- **macOS:** Run the `.pkg` installer — installs both VST3 and AU plugins
- **Windows:** Run the `.exe` installer — installs the VST3 plugin
- **Linux:** Extract and copy `MonkSynth.vst3` to `~/.vst3/`

## Themes

MonkSynth ships without a built-in skin. On first launch, it shows a setup screen where you can import the classic look from the original Delay Lama DLL (available as freeware from [audionerdz.nl](http://www.audionerdz.nl/download.htm)).

You can also load custom themes via right-click on the plugin GUI. A theme folder contains a `theme.json` manifest and any combination of these PNG files (missing ones fall back to 1x1 placeholders):

- `background.png` — main background (360x510)
- `monk-strip.png` — animation sprite sheet (5x6 grid, 311x311 frames)
- `knob-left.png` / `knob-right.png` — rotary knob filmstrips (50x3000, 60 frames)
- `fader-down-large.png` / `fader-down-sm.png` / `fader-right-sm.png` — fader handles
- `info.png` — info overlay (253x275)
